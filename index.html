        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Alice. I've worked in QA and DevOps roles for the last few years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a wide variety of technical experience, and I enjoy expanding my tech toolbelt
          and working on complex problems that may not have a clear answer.
          I learn things very quickly and I love collaborating with other people.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of now I am mainly interested in QA and DevOps/SRE roles at companies of any size,
          and I'm working on gaining frontend knowledge so I can make websites (you're on one now!)
          and make myself available for frontend and full stack roles.
        </p>

      <h2>University Work and Volunteering</h2>

      <p>Here are just a few of the projects I've worked on while earning my degree.</p>

      <section class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Senior Project - Wireless Stopwatch</h3>
        <p>
          The wireless stopwatch I worked on with my senior project team was intended
          to assist swimming coaches in timing young swimmers. According to our sponsor,
          the coaches always used a manual stopwatch as a backup for when the swimmers
          did not have enough force to press the pressure plate in the pool when switching
          back. The wireless part was to assist in noting down the times.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project itself included the stopwatch hardware, the embedded
          software on it, and a receiver desktop application with a GUI to
          display and record times.
        </p>
        <p>
          I primarily worked on the wireless communication between the device and the
          desktop app. For the wireless transmission protocol we chose LoRa, which is
          commonly used in IoT devices, because bluetooth did not give us the range
          capabilities that we needed. However, this decision brought some difficulty with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          LoRa is usually used with a protocol on top of it called LoRaWAN and a specialized
          router-like device to handle TX/RX for a network of devices, but we did not have the
          budget for one of these. Instead, I had to figure out the low-level details of the
          LoRa protocol and radio communication in general in order for the devices to
          communicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did eventually get it working with a LoRa USB dongle we tried out called a LoStik,
          but one unresolved issue we ran into was implementing multi-device support. For this
          we would have to develop CSMA/CA, but we simply did not have the time or resources
          to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall the project was a great experience for learning about embedded software and
          low-level radio communication that I would otherwise be oblivious to.

        <h3>Volunteering - Maize Elementary STEAM day</h3>
        <p>
          One of the requirements for graduating from a STEM degree at my university was
          completing some volunteer work related to your field of study. For mine, I worked with
          three other students to create an activity for a local elementary school's STEAM
          (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) day that took place in their gym.
        </p>
        <p>
          One resource the school had access to was these little robot toys (Dash) that could be
          programmed over bluetooth with an app based largely around the Scratch programming
          language (Blockly). I had the opportunity to take one home and create a quick activity which
          involved programming the robot to follow a known path on the ground and documenting it
          for future teacher use.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the STEAM day it was very interesting to see how the different grade levels interacted
          with the activity. For Kindergarten up to around second grade, we had to assist the students
          with setting up and running the robots quite a bit. There was a lot of confusion about what
          angles were for them. From third grade onwards, though, the students were very curious and
          experimenting with what they could do with the robots.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall it was a really great experience, and I got a chance to learn how technology can
          interface with education.
