        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Alice. I've worked in QA and DevOps roles for the last few years.
          I am mainly interested in working at companies with a SaaS and microservice
          infrastructure focus. In my day-to-day I primarily use Python, Bash, and Terraform for infrastructure and
          CI/CD automation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working on complex problems that may not have a clear
          answer. I am neurodivergent, so I do prefer more direct conversations than social
          situations that rely on social cues I may not pick up on. I think about things
          differently, not less.
        </p>

        <h3>(Senior) DevOps Engineer - Trend Micro</h3>
        <h4>January 2022 - January 2025</h4>
        <p>
          While my title in this role was technically Senior DevOps Engineer,
          I don't feel like it accurately describes the role. Regardless,
          here are some of my accomplishments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed and implemented an operations monitoring system for an AWS SaaS product using Terraform, Redshift,
            Kinesis Firehose, AWS Lambdas, Cloudwatch metrics and events, SNS, and Grafana to ensure the operations team
            could quickly respond to customer issues to ensure the 99.99% uptime SLA.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performed cloud cost optimizations of up to 20% by identifying key issues using AWS cost explorer to
            automate lifecycle rules for outdated EBS volumes and AMI images, as well as reducing networking costs by
            using services such as VPC gateway endpoints for VPC services accessing S3 and DynamoDB.
          </li>
          <li>
            Led migration of on-premise Jenkins deployment and testing pipelines to GitHub Actions, which greatly
            reduced maintenance costs and security concerns for DevOps, Quality Assurance, and IT departments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented deployments of specialized testing infrastructure in AWS and Azure cloud environments using
            Terraform, ARM templates, and CloudFormation to minimize spin-up and teardown times for CI and CR testing as
            well as lowering cloud costs for idle cloud resources.

        <h3>QA Engineer - Trend Micro</h3>
        <h4>June 2021 - December 2021</h4>
        <p>
          This was my first job out of college. I moved up very quickly to a devops role
          because of my hard work on learning AWS and our in-house processes, and because of
          my frequent communication across departments. This role focused on Python test
          automation for Trend Micro's TippingPoint and Cloud One systems.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Wrote automated Behavior Driven Development (BDD) tests using Python to test microservices in a cloud
            environment, ensuring service reliability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Handled testing of REST APIs using manual tests in TestRail and Postman.

        <h3>QA Student Contractor - NetApp</h3>
        <h4>June 2018 - December 2020</h4>
        <p>
          As my primary internship/contract during university, I worked through a lot of growing
          pains here as a new developer. There was also quite a lot of server room and
          rack-and-stack work I had to do here (server and network setup). I worked primarily in
          a small team for NetApp's E-Series SAN devices focused on solutions engineering.
          Specifically "Cloud Connector" and a prototype container running on the SAN controller.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Built a containerized disk monitoring system using InfluxDB, Telegraf and Grafana to detect and prevent
            widespread hardware failures due to misconfiguration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Led API and hardware testing for a cloud-integrated video archiving solution for surveillance systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performed manual, UI, and API testing for an AWS S3-based storage backup solution.

        <h4>2017 - June 2018</h4>
        <p>
          This role was not particularly CS focused, but it did give me the opportunity to
          get used to working in an office environment. Essentially it was mostly about
          data entry into Excel spreadsheets and troubleshooting electronic failures with
          experienced test engineers, but I also had the opportunity to develop data processing
          scripts using Perl.

      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <p>Here are just a few of the projects I've worked on over the years.</p>

      <section class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Senior Project - Wireless Stopwatch</h3>
        <p>
          The wireless stopwatch I worked on with my senior project team was intended
          to assist swimming coaches in timing young swimmers. According to our sponsor,
          the coaches always used a manual stopwatch as a backup for when the swimmers
          did not have enough force to press the pressure plate in the pool when switching
          back. The wireless part was to assist in noting down the times.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project itself included the stopwatch hardware, the embedded
          software on it, and a receiver desktop application with a GUI to
          display and record times.
        </p>
        <p>
          I primarily worked on the wireless communication between the device and the
          desktop app. For the wireless transmission protocol we chose LoRa, which is
          commonly used in IoT devices, because bluetooth did not give us the range
          capabilities that we needed. However, this decision brought some difficulty with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          LoRa is usually used with a protocol on top of it called LoRaWAN and a specialized
          router-like device to handle TX/RX for a network of devices, but we did not have the
          budget for one of these. Instead, I had to figure out the low-level details of the
          LoRa protocol and radio communication in general in order for the devices to
          communicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did eventually get it working with a LoRa USB dongle we tried out called a LoStik,
          but one unresolved issue we ran into was implementing multi-device support. For this
          we would have to develop CSMA/CA, but we simply did not have the time or resources
          to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall the project was a great experience for learning about embedded software and
          low-level radio communication that I would otherwise be oblivious to.
        </p>

        <h3>Volunteering - Maize Elementary STEAM day</h3>
        <p>
          One of the requirements for graduating from a STEM degree at my university was
          completing some volunteer work related to your field of study. For mine, I worked with
          three other students to create an activity for a local elementary school's STEAM
          (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) day that took place in their gym.
        </p>
        <p>
          One resource the school had access to was these little robot toys (Dash) that could be
          programmed over bluetooth with an app based largely around the Scratch programming
          language (Blockly). I had the opportunity to take one home and create a quick activity which
          involved programming the robot to follow a known path on the ground and documenting it
          for future teacher use.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the STEAM day it was very interesting to see how the different grade levels interacted
          with the activity. For Kindergarten up to around second grade, we had to assist the students
          with setting up and running the robots quite a bit. There was a lot of confusion about what
          angles were for them. From third grade onwards, though, the students were very curious and
          experimenting with what they could do with the robots.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall it was a really great experience, and I got a chance to learn how technology can
          interface with education.
